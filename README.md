## INFORMATION

This module enables the hidden call recording feature on OnePlus phones with Oxygen OS. This feature is normally only present on the sister OS, Hydrogen OS, designed for Chinese consumers. This is achieved by changing a hidden setting 30 seconds after the phone boots. The setting is reset on each boot so the script must be run each time the phone reboots.
